This assumption states that independent variables should be linearly independent to each other. In reality, many independent variables are correlated to each other. Some might have low correlations and some might have high correlations. We learned from the last module that if independent variables are highly correlated, we can check their correlations or VIFs and drop variables. We can also apply principal component analysis or factor analysis to address the issue.
